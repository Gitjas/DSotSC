@5    = ~I ain't got a care for the politics and crap goin' on.  Take all that flamin garbage and toss it to the crows.  Take all the metal away too, for all I care.  Don't need it to hunt.  Don't need it to kill.  Don't need it to smell them ogres neither.  Take my advice...er...mac, keep yer weapons ready.  ~
