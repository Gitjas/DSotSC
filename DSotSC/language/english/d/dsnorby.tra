@1 = ~Oh my! Did you hear the terrible news? A dragon is running loose through the streets of Nashkell!! Someone must stop it before it makes it to Beregost! I'm packing my stuff right now and heading to my Auntie Nora's in Baldur's Gate!~
@2 = ~A strange fellow just told us that the dragon that we were just sent to fight by Morninglord Jarent, was in the city of Nashkel. However, Morninglord Jarent told us that it was still some distance from Nashkel. Oh well, perhaps we should go check it out, just to be sure.~
