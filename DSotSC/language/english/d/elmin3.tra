@1 = ~Well my young friend, it wouldst seem that fate continues to bring us together.~
@2 = ~It would appear so. Though I don't quite understand it all. Isn't there anymore that you can tell me?~
@3 = ~Yes it does. But if you ask me I think it's a bit more than fate old man. I think you are following me around...are you making sure I don't get myself into trouble? Well let me tell you, I can take care of myself just fine!~
@4 = ~You will find the answers to all of your questions in time, young <CHARNAME>. It is not for me to interfere nor guide you in the path that you must take on your own. However, as I say that, I would like to provide one thing for you. You received an expertly crafted weapon from the smith Otho. That weapon is a very important item for you to retain. You will need it's strength in the very near future. If you will allow me this once I would like to place an enchantment on that item to further it's strength and performance. But, after I do this, I suggest that you take this weapon and have a blessing placed upon it. The evil that you are about to face requires a little help from divine intervention. And I believe someone in a most holy position suggested that they would help you when you needed it. Maybe this is the time? But for now...I will perform this task and take my leave of you.~
@5 = ~Well once again I met that eccentric but helpful old sage! He placed an enchantment on the mace that Otho made for us. This mace seems to very important. Elminster suggested that I have someone bless it as well. But who do I know that could do this? Hmm, perhaps the Morninglord that wanted his relic returned from the dragon could help?~
@6 = ~I don't doubt for a moment you can't , young <CHARNAME>. It is not for me to interfere nor guide you in the path that you must take on your own.

@7 = ~Well once again that weird old man came around pestering me. He says that he is not trying to influence me or interfere with my chosen path and yet he placed an enchantment on the mace that Otho made for us. He told me that it was necessary because of the great evil that I was about to face. I don't need his help or anyone else's. Whatever this great evil is I'm sure that I can take care of myself. Elminster suggested that I have someone bless it as well. Who do I know that could do that? Hmm, maybe that old man from the Temple east of Beregost that wanted his relic returned from the dragon would do it?~
