@1 = ~Hello, you are <CHARNAME> are you not? I am Lennan. I assume you have some news about my niece Ferium?~
@2 = ~Yes sir, and I have some bad news. I am regretfully sorry to tell you that your niece is dead!~
@3 = ~Yeah we found her alright. But, she had become a freakin' banshee...so we had to kill her!~
@4 = ~I see...and I see you have returned with her amulet...I..I thank you for your help..... here, take this letter to Otho, a dwarven master weaponsmith, in the Thunderhammer smithy. He is a very good friend of mine and he will make a weapon for you that will have very great importance in the near future. I thank you for your trouble. Good bye!~
@5 = ~We had to deliver some bad news to the uncle of Ferium, an elven maid from Cormanthor. His niece had been transformed into a horrible banshee and my party was forced to kill her. It was the best thing to do. Her spirit can now rest in peace. However, I didn't have the heart to tell Lennan the horrible truth, just that she is now in a happier place. We returned the amulet that her lover had given to her. I don't know what the circumstances were in that relationship, but I hope that he is made aware of the broken heart that he had given to Ferium. Lennan seemed very grateful to us and gave us a letter to take to a dwarven smithy by the name of Otho that was visiting the Thunderhammer Smithy. He told us that this long time friend of his would create for us a weapon that would be of great importance to us in the future. What he meant by that I don't know, but I'm sure I will find out.~
@6 = ~You...ah...she, I see...and I see you have returned with her amulet...I..well, I suppose you had to do what was necessary..... here, take this letter to Otho, a dwarven master weaponsmith, in the Thunderhammer smithy. He is a very good friend of mine and he will make a weapon for you that will have very great importance in the near future. I need to leave now, good bye!~
@7 = ~Well we told Lennan that his niece was dead. He didn't seem to take it well...but, I guess that's understandable. Anyway, he gave us a letter to take to a dwarven smithy by the name of Otho that was visiting the Thunderhammer Smithy. He told us that this long time friend of his would create for us a weapon that would be of great importance to us in the future. What did he mean by that? I wish people would just come out and say what they mean instead of speaking so mystical all the time....shesh.~
@8 = ~Have you not found my niece? Please I beg you...she is wandering out in the wilderness alone. Please find her!~
