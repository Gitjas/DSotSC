@1 = ~Fine, I'll be leaving the likes of you, then. This party's been just like a prison for me.~
@2 = ~You've been good to me, friends. Bust some heads, will you?~
@3 = ~I'd sooner be back at the Order if you merely wish to stroll about with no purpose. We must find that dragon and destroy it!~
@4 = ~What?~
@5 = ~Fine, I will take on the dragon myself. Good ridance to ya!~
